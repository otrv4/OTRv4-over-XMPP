# OTRv4 over XMPP

This document will eventually become an XEP.

This document will be used to define what issues need to be addressed for
OTRv4 to work correctly over XMPP.

## Important issues to consider over XMPP

### Explain how multicasting/synchronization will work

#### OMEMO:

From the security audit plus some comments:

"Assume Alice wants to send an OMEMO encrypted message from her phone. She can
detect that Bobâ€™s device(s) support OMEMO by requesting his device list with
PEP. If he does, she encrypts and authenticates her message using a randomly
generated key (`sym_k`). For every device that Alice wants to send the encrypted
message to, she fetches the entire bundle via PEP (sic: this means that a Key
Agreement is done per each device: how is the long-term secret key shared?). If
she wants to add more of her own devices in the conversation, she gets their
bundles as well from her own server. Alice creates a PreKeySignalMessage for
every device by picking a random one-time prekey from each bundle and
encrypting the randomly generated key to each device. She combines all
information in a single MessageElement: the encrypted payload (<payload/>), the
plaintext iv (<iv/>), the sender id (sid) and the encrypted
random key (<key/>) tagged with the corresponding receiver id (rid)"

1. Generate a random `sym_k`.
2. Calculate: `enc_key(32), auth_key(32), IV(16) := SHA-256(sym_k || 0x00 || "OMEMO Payload")`
3. Encrypt: `c := AES_CBC(enc_key, IV || message)`
4. Calculate: `MAC := SHA-256(auth_key || c)`
5. Concatenate: `payload := c || MAC`
6. Execute the double ratchet algorithm and generate a message key `mk`.
7. Calculate: `h_enc_key(32), auth_key(32), IV(16) := SHA-256(m_k || 0x00 || "OMEMO Message Key Material")`
8. Encrypt the payload: `h := (h_enc_key, payload)`

Since step 6, it is executed per device.
