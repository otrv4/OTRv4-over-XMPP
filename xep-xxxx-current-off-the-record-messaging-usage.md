# XEP-xxxx: Current Off-the-Record Messaging Usage

## Introduction

The Off-the-Record messaging protocol (OTR) was originally introduced in the
2004 paper Off-the-Record Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP [1] and has
since become the de facto standard for performing end-to-end encryption. OTR
provides confidentiality, deniability, authentication, and forward and
backwards secrecy.

The OTR protocol itself is currently described by the document: Off-the-Record
Messaging Protocol version 4 [2] and will not be described here. Instead, this
document aims to describe OTR's usage in its current version (version 4) and
best practices within XMPP.
